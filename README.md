# Hello-World

Review of steps from the begining

I need to do this as practice for the final project...DUE in a few days :(
There are going to be some long screen hours in my near future.

That tutorial worked fine.  Now I need a project to focus on.
  - !!Determine Project Idea
  - Figure out Notebooks
  - Create Slides 
  - Send slides
  - Tweak and revise as necessary to survive the class
  
Remember to peel through the readme files from the lectures to figure out formatting tricks.

How do I import links, images, change font?
